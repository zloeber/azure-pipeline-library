# azure-pipeline-library
A library of azure pipeline code and tasks, largely for personal use.

## Mindset Bias

I'm personally of the mindset that one should not be bound by a pipeline to get a job done. As such most of the component parts of these pipeline definitions are broken down into easy to transpose chunks of bash script code that can be run on any linux based system. Many of these are simply ripped straight from Makefiles and other scripts of mine in fact.
